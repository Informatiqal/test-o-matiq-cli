# These tests can be also split in multiple files
# The test runner will pick all files with specific naming eg in test1.spec.yaml -> *.spec.yaml
# The tests will be ran against specific app (apps?). The id will be defined when executed
# if this is part of qlBuilder then the qlBuilder config can be used
